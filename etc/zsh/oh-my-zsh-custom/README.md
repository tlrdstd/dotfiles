This etc/zsh/oh-my.zsh points `$ZSH_CUSTOM` to this
directory to tell oh-my-zsh to look here for custom
themes/extensions/etc.

Default location is etc/zsh/oh-my-zsh/custom, but is
inside the oh-my-zsh git repo, and I like to keep
everything outside of that for easy git repo management.

See https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Customization#using-another-customization-directory
for more details.
